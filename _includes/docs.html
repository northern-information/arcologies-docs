    <hr>
    <p>Cells are the building blocks of <strong>arcologies</strong>. Each key of grid represents a cell. Each cell has a structure, but these structures can be changed. Structures define qualities, behaviors, and attributes of a cell. Cells do one of three things:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Manipulate signals.</li>
      <li>Play sounds on norns.</li>
      <li>Communicate with outboard gear.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Cells also have four ports, each of which can either be open or closed. Ports direct the flow of signals.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>Like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon#Wave%E2%80%93particle_duality_and_uncertainty_principles">photons</a>, signals are the elementary particle of <strong>arcologies</strong>. All signals are created equal: they move at the same speed, have the same attributes, and interact with the world around them exactly as each other signal would. Signals really only have one meaningful attribute: a <em>heading</em>.</p>
    <p>Signals move in straight lines. Signal headings are simply the cardinal directions of north, east, south, and west.</p>
    <p>Signals allow cells to interact at a distance. Some cells emit signals. Other cells destroy signals. Yet others multiply, divide, and change the direction of signals.</p>
    <p>If two (or more) would occupy the same coordinate at the same time, they will all be destroyed.</p>
    <p>Signals are destroyed when they leave the boundaries of the grid.</p>
    <p>In <strong>arcologies</strong> the glyph for a signal is <code>Y</code>.</p>

    <h2 id="miscellanea">Miscellanea</h2>
    <hr>

    <h3>&mdash; Port Nuance</h3>
    <p>On the grid, ports are only <em>displayed as adjacent</em> to the selected cell. The ports are actually just attributes of a given cell/key. Each cell has 4 ports (unless the cell is along the perimeter of the grid in which case they have only 3 <span style="font-size:.75rem">(or 2 for corners <span style="font-size:.5rem">(sorry, I know it is complicated)</span>)</span>.)</p>
    <p>In other words, think of ports at little tardigrade-sized doors on the walls of the keys themselves.</p>
    <p>This means cells can be right next to each other and talk freely between their ports. When you select a cell, that cells ports will be drawn over any adjacent cells, but the adjacent cells continue to exist.</p>

    <h3>&mdash; Cellular Memory</h3>
    <p>In general, cells will remember their attributes as they mutate between structures. This means you can have a hive with a metabolism configured, then switch it to a shrine, then back to a hive the same metabolism will remain. The gate (which doesn't have metabolism) won't erase them.
    <p>One key exception to this is notes. Topiaries "re-roll" their notes every mutation. Fickle things, topiaries.</p>

    <h3>&mdash; Leylines</h3>
    <p>Leylines help you visualize the signal flow of your arcology. Opening a port will draw a leyline to a terminus (either a neighboring cell or the edge of the grid.) Leylines are purely decorative and have no functional impact on your arcology.</p>
    
    <h3>&mdash; Time Signature & Polyrhythms</h3>
    <p>The concept of time signatures and polyrhythms absolutely exist in <strong>arcologies</strong> - they just aren't labeled with traditional music terms. First, change "length" (on the home page) to set how many beats are in a bar. Then, select a hive (or any signal emitter: dome, maze, etc.) and set the metabolism. You'll graphically see how these two attributes interact ons-creen. With a global length of 16 and a hive with a metabolism of 7, for example, you'll be able to create a "<strong>1</strong>-2-3-4-5-6-7-<strong>1</strong>-2-3-4-5-6-7-<strong>1</strong>-2" type of rhythm.</p>
    <p>Finally, change the hive's offset. Note that since signals all move at the same speed concepts like irregular rests or triplets don't exist. Perhaps one day there will be a triplet structure that fires off bursts...</p>

    <h3>&mdash; Seeding</h3>
    <p>Seeding is purely random process with some opinionated boundaries for the various parameters. Your existing arcology has no impact on the result of a seed. Seeding destroys the current arcology. Seeding is arbitrarily capped to 32 cells (anything more than this felt super chaotic to me.) Seeding is not intelligent - you may generate an inert arcology with just 20 gates (unlikely), or the most beautiful symphony of all time (even more unlikely.) I find the feature a really fun way to get inspired and start a session.</p>

    <h3>&mdash; Pun?</h3>
    <p><strong>arcologies</strong> is not a pun on monome arc. However, I do plan to add optional arc features in the future.</p>

    <h3>&mdash; Crypt Management</h3>
    <p>By default, crypt cells source files matching the pattern <code>{1,2,3,4,5,6}.wav</code> from <code>/home/we/dust/audio/arcologies/crypt/*</code>. Note this directory is a descendant of <code>audio/arcologies/</code>. Just drop your files in this directory and you'll be ready to play samples.</p>
    <p>If you wish to use DLC from <a href="https://github.com/tyleretters/crypts"><strong>crypts</strong></a> you can configure your the source directory via the norns parameters menu. An arcology can only use one crypt at a time.</p>
    <p>To get started, either download or clone <strong>crypts</strong> to <code>/home/we/dust/audio</code> (i.e. <code>cd dust/audio && git clone git@github.com:/tyleretters/crypts crypts</code>). If you don't want to deal with that and just want to load your own samples, simply create the directories and drop the files in.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>These brief challenges are a great starting point for learning <strong>arcologies</strong>.</p>
    <h3>&mdash; Chords</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Using only one hive and three shrines, make a chord.</li>
      <li>Now change the hive into a gate. Add a new hive to send signals to the gate.</li>
      <li>Now add second chord by adding a second hive but <em>only one more shrine</em>.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>&mdash; Arpeggio</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Using only one hive and six shrines, create an arpeggio.</li>
      <li>Add six more shrines to create a second arpeggio.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>&mdash; Interference</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Signals cancel each other out. Use this to your advantage and create a melody that gets mutilated by a rave, dome, or maze. Perhaps hives to the west, shrines to the east, and chaos between?</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>&mdash; Packt</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Using five hives and five shrines (or topiaries), create a melody but make sure you cannot see any of the signals.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>&mdash; Rainy Day</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Create a melody with topiaries and shrines <em>that only receive signals from solariums</em>.</li>
      <li>Perform by playing the solariae's charge.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>&mdash; Tales from the Crypt</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Create (or dredge up) twelve samples.</li>
      <li>Create two directories and divide the files into two sets of six.</li>
      <li>Name each set <code>1.wav</code>, <code>2.wav</code>, <code>3.wav</code>, <code>4.wav</code>, <code>5.wav</code>, & <code>6.wav</code>.</li>
      <li>Copy the pair of directories to norns at <code>/dust/audio/arcologies</code>.
      <li>Now, rename one of them to <code>crypt</code> and play the samples with a crypt cell.</li>
      <li>While playing, swap the directory names: <code>mv crypt crypt_tmp && mv inactive_crypt crypt && mv crypt_tmp inactive_crypt</code>. What (doesn't) happen?</li>
      <li>What happens when you adjust the index on a crypt?</li>
      <li>Install <strong><a href="https://github.com/tyleretters/crypts">crypts</a></strong> & relaunch <strong>arcologies</strong>.</li>
      <li>Play samples with a crypt cell.</li>
      <li>While playing, navigate to the main norns edit menu and change the "CRYPT(S)" parameter.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>&mdash; Syncopation</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Using two vales with low ranges and two hives with high metabolisms, create a syncopated bassline.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>For monome <a href="https://monome.org/docs/norns">norns</a> and <a href="https://monome.org/docs/grid">grid</a>, <strong>arcologies</strong> is a 21st century instrument for musical composition and discovery.</p>
    <p>The core design objective for this software is clarity. Each key and encoder on norns have a dedicated function. All the keys on the grid share the same behavior. The menus are built to be fast, intuitive, cohesive, and consistent. With a foundation that is (hopefully) quick to master, the arcologist's focus can shift to sculpting emergent and complex compositions.</p>
    <p>The design of <strong>arcologies</strong> heavily inspired by the two-dimensionality of <a href="https://100r.co/site/orca.html">Orca</a>, the polymorphism of <a href="https://ornament-and-cri.me/">ornament & crime</a>, the immediacy of <a href="https://monome.org/docs/meadowphysics/">meadowphysics</a>, and the uncompromising vision of <a href="https://l.llllllll.co/cheat-codes">cheat codes</a>.
